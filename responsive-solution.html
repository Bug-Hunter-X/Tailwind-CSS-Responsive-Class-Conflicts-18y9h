The solution involves carefully considering the order of responsive classes and using more specific class names to avoid conflicts. This can be done by using more descriptive class names, such as `md:px-4` and `lg:px-8`, instead of relying on a single class that tries to handle multiple responsive states simultaneously.  Additionally, using Tailwind's `@apply` directive or writing custom CSS may offer cleaner and more understandable solutions.
