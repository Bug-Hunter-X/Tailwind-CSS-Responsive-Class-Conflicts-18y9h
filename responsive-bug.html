This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with complex responsive designs.  The issue arises when applying multiple responsive classes to the same element, leading to unexpected styling conflicts. For example, applying `md:px-4 lg:px-8` to a div might result in `px-8` being applied at both `md` and `lg` breakpoints instead of `px-4` at `md` and `px-8` at `lg`. The order of class declarations matters significantly and can be difficult to debug.
